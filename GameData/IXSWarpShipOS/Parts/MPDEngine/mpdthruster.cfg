	description = Lorentz Kerman faced a somewhat uphill battle in convincing the other WarpTech engineers that Magnetoplasmadynamic wasn't just a word that he made up, but he eventually succeeded and they were able to produce this revolutionary engine. It is capable of producing a large amount of thrust using very little fuel, but its electric power demands are enormous.
