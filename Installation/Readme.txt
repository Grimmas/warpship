WarpShip is an update and expansion of the IXS Enterprise, focusing on updating everything to work properly in 1.0.2, adding some futuristic functionality while maintaining good integration with stock parts, and creating some new gameplay options but not adding too much complexity to the game. The core of the mod is, of course, Stevie_D's IXS Enterprise parts, but it also adds several models from KSP Interstellar in order to give more flexibility when building your WarpShip. However, WarpShip itself is not all that compatible with KSP Interstellar and the parts generally do vastly different things.

NOTE: If you are upgrading from an earlier version of WarpShip, you should delete your old GameData/WarpShip directory or there will probably be issues with textures.

Parts included in this mod are:
- IXS Command Module
- IXS Main Hull
- IXS Crew Habitat
- IXS Mobile Science Laboratory
- IXS Holding Tank
- IXS Fuel Tank
- Alcubierre Warp Drive
- Warp Drive Enhancer
- WT-01 Magnetoplasmadynamic Thruster
- WT-02 Quantum Vacuum Thruster
- Advanced Science Pod
- Advanced Sensor Array
- Antimatter Collector
- Develocitizer
- Jool Gas Collector
- Xenon Concentrator
- Plasma Reactor
- Warp Plasma Tank
- Zero Point Generator
- Communotron 99-99
- Enhanced Inline Stabilizer
- Mk3 to 3.75m Adapter (Xenon)
- Clamp-O-Tron 3.75m Docking Port
- Spacedocks

WarpShip is a standalone mod, but it borrows extensively from:
- Stevie_D's IXS Enterprise (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92816-NASA-IXS-Class-Warpship-and-Spacedocks-For-KSP-I-and-Stock-KSP)
- RoverDude's Alcubierre Warp Drive (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100798-1-0-Alcubierre-Warp-Drive-%28Stand-alone%29-v0-2-0-2015-04-27)
- KSP Interstellar (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43839-0-25-KSP-Interstellar-%28Magnetic-Nozzles-ISRU-Revamp%29-Version-0-13)

I am simply giving credit where credit is due; none of these mods are required to use WarpShip and in fact will probably clash with it. Firespitter is also no longer required, as I've borrowed the needed code from it as well.

Derivatives of stuff from KSP Interstellar, the Alcubierre Warp Drive, Firespitter, and the original IXS Enterprise are covered by the same license as the original.

I did not make any of the models used except for the Zero Point Generator. All credit for the other models goes to their original authors.
