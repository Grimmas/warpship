description = The Quantum Vacuum Thruster is a unique sort of engine in that it need not carry along any reaction mass. Instead, it relies on something known as quantum vacuum virtual plasma, and pushes against the very fabric of the universe itself. Apparently the very fabric of the universe itself glows a vibrant shade of green... or perhaps some other color.
