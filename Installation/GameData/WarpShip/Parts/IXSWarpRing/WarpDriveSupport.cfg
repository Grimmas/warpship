description = One warp ring is nice, but two are even better. Three is just excessive, of course. This additional ring contains optional support functionality for the Alcubierre Warp Drive: It enlarges the warp bubble, enhances the ship's stability during warp flight, and has a self-powered supply of Warp Plasma for the drive as well additional power available.
