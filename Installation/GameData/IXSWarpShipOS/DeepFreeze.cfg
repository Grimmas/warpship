	description = Based on RepoSoftTech's CRY-2300 unit, the CRY-IXS is adapted for use on the IXS 01 'Enterprise' prototype. Designed for long term storage of up to 10 Kerbals. The CRY-IXS uses Glykerol and ElectricCharge to freeze or thaw one Kerbal.
Please ensure you have enough ElectricCharge capacity on your ship. The CRY-IXS comes stocked with 100 units of Glykerol.
CAUTION: The CRY-IXS also requires ElectricCharge per minute per Kerbal to keep it's Monitoring Systems Functioning. If it cannot get this ElectricCharge 
there is a risk of frozen Kerbals dying.
