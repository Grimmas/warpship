	description = The Resource Sensor Array contains a multitude of detection devices for all your sensing and detecting needs, capable of performing general orbital surveys as well as scanning a specific area in detail. If this sensor array can't find it, it's probably not worth finding. Don't forget to include a transmitter to send the data back to Kerbin.
