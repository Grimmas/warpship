	description = This sophisticated reactor converts Liquid Deuterium into usable electrical energy via a patented and top-secret process involving a lot of fancy physics words. Seriously, the thing also includes a small transmitter that notifies WarpTech's lawyers if you even think of trying to open it and figure out how it works.
